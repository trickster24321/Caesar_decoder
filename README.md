# Caesar_decoder
a simple java code which can bruteforce caesar cypher by switching the shift

# how to run

open the project folder in a java supported IDE and run the main.java file using the IDE

# how to use

input the cypher text when prompted in the CLI and it will output a series of different texts one of which contain a deciphered meaningful text.

# how it works

takes the input and turns it into a series of uppercase strings and then takes each character and send it through a simple algorithm which convert each latter according to the shift and this is done until all the characters are converted according to the shift

this is process is done continously for 25 times to account for all the shifts and therefor one of the shifts is bound to be the correct answer thus bruteforcing the cipher text.

for an example try the ciphertext: khoor
